# 1. Action Space
Change the `GameSolver` algorithm so it asks not for the child states, but for the action space. Do this so the return type of the algorithm can be an action to achieve the desired state instead of the new state itself.

# 2. Choose game from console
Make it so that the game to play is chosen AFTER the program is run, as opposed to choosing it by manipulating the code.

# 3. Play- classes for `TurkishCheckers` and `TicTacToe`

# 4. Restructure
Move the test files of the game states to the folder of the respective game?
